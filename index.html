<p>Over 6.5 million Turkish citizens live abroad, according to the OECD, “the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is less than the OECD average of USD 30,490 a year.” In addition, “When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, Turks gave it a 4.9 grade on average, lower than the OECD average of 6.7.” </p>

<p>One German study from 2022 found that almost 73% of young Turkish citizens wished to live abroad, among the top reasons cited were economic decay, nepotism and political corruption, quality of life and education.</p>

<p>Below is a summary of why these factors are contributing to the trend of Turkish youth emigrating out of the country.</p>

<h2> 1. Economic Decay </h2>


<p> Turkey currently has an inflation rate of 61%, and the youth unemployment rate is at around 17%, with an average salary of 4050 Turkish Lira per month, which is equivalent to around 145 USD. The average rent in Turkey is around $300-800 per month and the average monthly cost of living is around 408 USD excluding rent. In an article from September, one student told Foreign Policy “‘I decided to work full time instead,” she said. “Of course I don’t want to quit my studies, but right now I can’t even afford campus accommodation. The economic crisis affects us students greatly—both in terms of not being able to afford studies as well as the fear of not finding work in our field after graduation.’ For now, she has moved back in with her parents and deferred her junior year, spending her time working for an online retailer.” </p>

<h2> 2. Political Corruption </h2>

<p> Turkey is among one of the most corrupt countries in the world, and freedom of speech is highly censored. According to Balkan Insight, “57 journalists were killed, 65 journalists were held hostage and 49 journalists remain missing” in 2022 based on a Reporters Without Borders report. Trading Economics ranks Turkey’s corruption index at 36, right below Thailand, compared to the United States which is at 69. In a data pool of 180 countries, Turkey falls under 101 according to Transparency International. </p>

<h2> 3. Quality of Life </h2>

<p> Based on the OECD’s Better Life Index, Turkey underperforms in areas such as the career market, work-life balance, education, health, social connections, and life satisfaction. General life satisfaction is ranked at at 4.9 on a scale of 10, compared to the OECD average of 6.7. </p>

<h2> 4. Education </h2>

<p> As academics begin leaving the country, particularly those with more of an anti-establishment view, Turkish youth are concerned about the future of academia and education in the country. In 2018, Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia Director at the Human Rights Watch said “‘The Turkish government’s crackdown is targeting academics and damaging its universities…Academics and students should be free to express, teach, and research controversial or critical ideas without risking dismissal or imprisonment.’” In 2022, three deans from the country’s prestigious Boğaziçi University were fired, raising alarm of the country’s decrease in educational freedom and its institutionalization. </p>
